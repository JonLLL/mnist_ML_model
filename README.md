# mnist_ML_model
this is a model i built that uses a convolutional NN to detect handwritten digit. <br>
this was trained and validated onthe mnist dataset <br>
To test model i drew digits on ms paint <br>

## in this repo
training - training script ran on jupyter notebook <br>
detection - python script given hand drawn image prints prediction in terminal  to run `python detection.py "input-image" `<br>
test-images - a folder of hand drawen images for testing<br>

### notes/limitations
although high accuacry score on validation, in real testing it does not always classify correctly. especially on images where digits are not drawn in the middle<br>
